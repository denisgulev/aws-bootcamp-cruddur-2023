# Week 9 â€” CI/CD with CodePipeline with CodeBuild

## CodePipeline

To create a new Pipeline, follow these steps:
1. give it a name
2. choose "New service role"
3. click "Next"
4. choose "Source provider" (e.g. GitHub)
5. choose Github (via GithubApp)
6. create a connection to github repository
7. select the repository and branch (create a new branch "prod")
8. for output artifact format -> leave the default
9. check "Start pipeline on push and pull request events"
10. skip build stage (we'll see it later on)
11. skip tests stage (we'll see later on)
12. deploy state -> select Amazon ECS for the provider
    1. choose the cluster
    2. choose the service
    3. click "Next"
13. click "Create pipeline"
14. At first it will fail, because we haven't created the build stage yet
15. go and create a "CodeBuild" project
    1. add a source from Github
    2. choose the repository and branch
    3. make sure to 
    4. make sure to NOT choose a VPC and subnets, otherwise it will not be able to communicate with github
    5. in the environment section
       1. check "Privileged - Enable this flag if you want to build Docker images or want your builds to get elevated privileges"
       2. choose "Amazon Linux" for OS
       3. runtime -> standard
       4. images -> latest "aarch64" available
       5. compute -> minimum available
    6. create a "buildspec.yaml" file in the backend folder
    7. attach "codebuild-to-ecr-policy.json" to codebuild role
16. **ONCE** CodeBuild is up and tested, move back to CodePipeline
17. click "Edit" and add a "Build" stage between "Source" and "Deploy"
18. choose to use the CobeBuild project created earlier
19. set explicit "Output Artifacts" on the build stage
20. use the same artifact as "Input Artifacts" for the deploy stage

## Security Best Practices

- Make use each AWS service you want to use is available in your region
- Restrict access to the account allowed to make changes to the pipeline
- Provide specific roles for the pipeline

from an application point of view:
- IAM users and roles -> create these with "the least privilege" principle in mind
- repository code should be trusted -> only certain events (ex commit on 'prod' branch) should trigger the pipeline
-
