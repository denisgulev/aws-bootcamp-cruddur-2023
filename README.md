- Application: Cruddur

A micro-blogging platform with expiring posts offers a safer, more engaging user experience by reducing personal data exposure, 
limiting harmful content, and fostering community-focused, present-moment interactions. 
Its ephemeral nature drives monetization through increased user engagement, exclusive content, 
and targeted advertising opportunities. Cruddur is designed as an ephemeral-first public micro-blogging platform. 
This unique approach positions Cruddur to build trust and boost engagement.
